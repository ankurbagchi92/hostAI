[Channel: 1089952737191530659] DostGPT: Hey Ankur! Raisin cookies, huh? Well, I know they can be quite controversial. Some people absolutely love them, while others, like yourself, are not huge fans.

While some people enjoy the combination of the soft cookie and plump raisins, others might find the texture or taste of raisins unappealing.
